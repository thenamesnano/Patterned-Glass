<h3>About Patterned Glass</h3>
<p>Patterned Glass was an idea originally posted by user noxzos_ on the Minecraft Forum.
I was looking for new mod ideas when I happened upon the post and decided to take on the project.
The mod adds in stained-glass variants with glazed terracotta patterns on them.  They can be rotated to
make vanilla+ style stained-glass mosaics.</p>
<p>There is a Fabric version of this mod, but it is no longer being maintained by myself.
You can find the ReviversMC fork <a href="https://github.com/ReviversMC/patterned-glass">here</a>.</p>

<h3>To Modpack Developers</h3>
<p>Do whatever you want with the mod buy please don't bundle it on the Technic platform.
That ecosystem is terrible and many mod creators including myself do not support it.
Ultimately I cannot stop you nor do I care to try, but if you want to do right by me then credit with links is appreciated.</p>
